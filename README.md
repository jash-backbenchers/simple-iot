<h1>Description</h1>
this is just a simple demo on how to implement iot in jst 20 lines and 5min</br>
here i have used 2 routes.and i havnt posted any data to server.this code is not good practice but i have done this to give u a general idea</br>

<h1>For running,follow these steps</h1>

1.make sure python and flask are installed properly </br>
2.run the server by using command python <code>ledserver.py</code></br>
3.note down the ip address on which the server is running</br>
4.change the ip address in the led.html file to the address uptained in step 4</br>
5.connect led to 11pin of pi</br>
6.run led.html and play with led :p</br>

<h2>your next development should include</h2>
1.use only one route </br>
2.posting data from client</br> 
3.receiving data at server</br>
4.turn led based on received data</br>
